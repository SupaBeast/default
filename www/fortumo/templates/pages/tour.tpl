            <h2 class="caption03">No Startup Fee. No Monthly Fee. No Minimum Commitments.</h2>
            <p>Some mobile payments providers are charging developers thousands of euros per month. Some also require minimum monthly commitments. Fortumo believes in supporting our developers and enabling monetization in a fair manner. So, we think it's fair that we only make money, when our developers make money. Therefore, we have no fixed fees or commitments.</p>
