Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small <i>river named Duden flows</i> by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia.

Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a copy.</p>
      
            <p>The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its own, safe country.</p>
      
            <p>But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects again and again.
